DISCLAIMER: Code and all associcated files to be run on Jupyter Notebook. A few of the clickable countries don't have readable graphs as they are not in the European Union (EU),
e.g. Iceland, Belarus, etc. A few countries also have a missing section at the start of their graph as they joined the EU after the year 2005.

This repository is about the comparison between EU petrol and diesel prices from 2005 - 2020. It includes the code, database, map files and csv file for an interactive
