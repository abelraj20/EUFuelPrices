DISCLAIMER: Code and all associcated files to be run on Jupyter Notebook. A few of the clickable countries don't have readable graphs as they are not in the European Union (EU),
e.g. Iceland, Belarus, etc. A few countries also have a missing section at the start of their graph as they joined the EU after the year 2005, e.g. Romania, etc.

This repository is about the comparison between EU petrol and diesel prices from 2005 - 2023. It includes the code, database, map files and csv file for an interactive 
visualisation. The map has multiple features such as scrolling, zooming in, zooming out and clicking. Changes in prices for both fuel types were graphically represented on 
a map, enabling viewers to observe differences between prices in various countries within the same region. An investigation was conducted to determine whether this correlation 
was negative, positive, or neutral by plotting each fuel type's prices as a function of time. An interactive visualisation was designed that allowed users to select a specific 
country. Upon selecting a country on the map, a graph displaying the average prices for both petrol and diesel from 2005 - 2023 would appear to the right of the map.
